- Image processing

  For python code for image processing, you should have opencv and numpy packages in your python interpreter. 

  And you should also change the `filename` into your own file path.

  You should put file `utils` with other files into one same folder, since some functions in `utils` are necessary.

- FEC

  For running FEC report codes, you should have  `icarus verilog`. And to finish the report, you should have `gtkwave` to get the time diagram.

  For **lab4**, since there is no variant, its code can be used directly without any changes. 

  For **lab5**, it's based on lab3 and lab4. So, the `periph_dev` and `final` part maybe largely different from my code. The other parts can be used with little modifications.

  For other labs, my codes can only be viewed as an example since the variants maybe different from yours.
